# InfoJobs-Scrap
This project scraps all the jobs in this search: https://www.infojobs.net/ofertas-trabajo?keyword=Instalador%2Fa%20de%20paneles%20solares%20fotovoltaicos

And for each of the 96 job postings, like this one: https://www.infojobs.net/tortosa/fotovotaica-montadores-placas-electricistas-tortosa/of-ie17a00bb064075938f12208a404059?applicationOrigin=search-new%7Cversion%7Ebackpack_sorted_no_norm&page=1&sortBy=RELEVANCE

Extract all the information as explained in this PPT: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lhcp85ez-APKl1pfPlafgkE0__WzHxePXyCm-cIULlU/edit?usp=sharing

Into a format like this one:

I would like to have:
- A first confirmation email that you can do this and an estimate of time, any doubts you may have, and any problems you foresee
- A first output as good as you can get with a reasonable effort
- A short meeting or email conversation on potential fine tunings (I will be very short, and adapt where possible). If you follow the example, no fine tuning will be needed
- A final output
- Save all the sources: We may ask for more iterations. As the work for coding will already be done, I expect future iterations on the same format and source to be cheaper (but profitable for both of us - to be negotiated)

This can be a good exercise for someone starting and learning, or for someone already knowledgeable that can do this quite quick.
